Project for suvivor picks dashboard https://erichdenk.shinyapps.io/survivor-pool/

My extended family and some friends are big fans of the long-running television show _Survivor_. We play a game where after the first episode of each season 
everyone submits their "fantasy tribe", those they think are most likely to win the season, designating one castaway as MVP for bonus points. Previously, I kept score
using a google doc. Instead, this shiny app provides a dashboard for scorekeeping and adds some fun elements such as charts of the most popular picks. 
I'll add more features as I become more comfortable with Shiny.
